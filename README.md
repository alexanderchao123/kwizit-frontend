# Kwizit

Kwizit is an interactive multiplayer quiz game. Teachers can create and host quizzes to engage his/her students through separate devices in a classroom setting to measure individual student's performance. To begin playing, the teacher selects a quiz and clicks on the "Start Round" button and a unique pin is generated on screen. The questions and results will appear on the teacher's screen, so all the students must be able to view it. On separate devices, students can join the round by entering the pin. After the instructor starts the round, the teacher's screen will render the first question and the students' screen will render the multiple choice page.
